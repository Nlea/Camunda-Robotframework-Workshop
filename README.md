**Description:**

Imagine you start your day at Robocon: You need coffee! 

Before you order your coffee you fill out a [survey](https://www.buzzfeed.com/rileyroach/which-coffee-are-you-572dyo73ow) to find out what kind of coffee you are most like. The next step is to get all the ingrients for the defined coffee type. Once you have the ingrients you can prepare the coffee. Once your coffee is ready you want to tweet about it before you finally drink it.
